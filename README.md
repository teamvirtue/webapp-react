# Web App Functionalities
Through the web app the residents are able to view their behaviour in terms of sustainability, the status of LINQ and
control certain systems in the house. The idea is to make the smart system easier accessible this way. The web app is a
responsive website so it is accessible for every device, like a laptop phone or even the tv. The main navigation exists
of four tabs: home, control, reports and settings

The app allows residents to anonymously,check their sustainability status compared to the average neighbour, compare the
complex other LINQ complexes and on an urban scale. The energy and water usages can be viewed in more detail such as
graphs and other figures, in addition to the clock. Every appliance can be individually reviewed for their energy and
water consumption. Moreover, the lights and temperature in the house can be controlled through the web app. For the
lights, the power, brightness and colour can be controlled for either an individual room or the whole house. Addionally,
the operational status of the building systems are included in the web app as well.

Finally, in the settings tab the resident can individually change their account info and preferences, set work or home
schedules and sign out of their account.
